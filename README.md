# YouTube Homepage UI Clone

This is a front-end clone of the YouTube homepage layout built using HTML and CSS.  
The goal of this project was to practice responsive layout techniques using Flexbox, CSS Grid, positioning, and media queries.

The project focuses on recreating the structure and behavior of the YouTube home screen — header, sidebar, and video grid — without using any frameworks or JavaScript.
